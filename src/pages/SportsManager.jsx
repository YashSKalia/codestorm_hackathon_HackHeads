                        <h2>What is a Sports Manager?</h2>
                        <p>
                        Sports managers are business managers. They are responsible for handling the business matters of professional and collegiate sports teams, as well as individual professional athletes. While these are the most recognized roles associated with sports management, it is important to note that the field extends beyond them, and includes areas such as recreation and sports facility management. In other words, sports managers operate in a variety of capacities, all of which are aimed at promoting the goals and profitability of a sports organization.

                        <p>Because of the wide scope of sports management, not all jobs in the field are the same. Depending on their employer and their role, sports managers may be data analysts, decision makers, accountants and budgeters, contract negotiators, business strategists, financial asset managers, public relations specialists, marketers, facility managers, or a combination of two or more of these. Wherever they land professionally, sports managers are invariably called upon to be communicators, problem solvers, and leaders.</p>
